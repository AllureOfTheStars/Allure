Minimal cheat sheet for casual play (1/2).

 Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (left diagram below)
 or its compact laptop replacement (middle) or the Vi text editor keys (right,
 enabled in config.ui.ini). Run, until disturbed, by adding Shift or Control.
 Go-to with LMB (left mouse button). Run collectively with RMB.

 In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair (aiming crosshair).
 Press 'KP_5' ('5' on keypad, if present) to wait, bracing for impact,
 which reduces any damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press
 'C-KP_5' (the same key with Control) to wait 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.
 You displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or RMB. Search,
 open, descend and attack by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
 The best item to attack with is automatically chosen from among
 weapons in your personal equipment and your unwounded organs.

 anything in the game, though not necessarily with the fewest keystrokes.

Mouse overview.

 Screen area and UI mode (aiming/exploration) determine mouse click effects.
 Here is an overview of effects of each button over most of the game map area.
 The list includes not only left and right buttons, but also the optional
 middle mouse button (MMB) and even the mouse wheel, which is normally used
 over menus, to page-scroll them, rather than over game map.
 For mice without RMB, one can use C-LMB (Control key and left mouse button).

 LMB          set x-hair to enemy/go to pointer for 25 steps
 RMB or C-LMB fling at enemy/run to pointer collectively for 25 steps

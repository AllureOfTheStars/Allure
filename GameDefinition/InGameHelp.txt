Minimal cheat sheet for casual play.

  \|/         (top diagram) or the Vi editor keys (bottom) or with a compact
 4-5-6        laptop setup (middle) that needs to be enabled in config.ui.ini.

              with LMB (left mouse button). Run collectively with S-LMB
              (press the button while holding Shift).

  \|/         In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair
 u-i-o        (aiming crosshair). Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait,
  /|\         bracing for impact, which reduces any damage taken
 j k l        and prevents displacement by foes. Press `C-KP_5` or `C-KP_5`
              (the same key with Shift or Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn,
              without bracing.

  \|/         You displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control
 h-.-l        or S-LMB. Search, open, descend and attack by bumping into
  /|\         walls, doors, stairs and enemies. The best item to attack with
 b j n        is automatically chosen from among melee weapons in your
              personal equipment and your body parts.

 The following commands, joined with the basic set above,
 let you accomplish anything in the game, though
 not necessarily with the fewest keystrokes. You can also
 play the game exclusively with a mouse, or both mouse
 and keyboard. (See the ending help screens for mouse commands.)
 Lastly, you can select a command with arrows or mouse directly
 from the help screen or the dashboard and execute it on the spot.

 keys         command
 E            manage equipment of the leader
 g or ,       grab item(s)
 ESC          open main menu/finish aiming
 RET or INS   open dashboard/accept target
 SPACE        clear messages and show history
 S-TAB        cycle among all party members
 KP_* or !    cycle x-hair among enemies
 KP_/ or /    cycle x-hair among items
 c            close door
 %            yell/yawn


Here is the complete list of commands from the snapshot of in-game help.
For more general gameplay information see
https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/GameDefinition/PLAYING.md

Item menu commands.

 keys         command
 g or ,       grab item(s)
 d or .       drop item(s)
 f            fling projectile
 C-f          auto-fling and keep choice
 a            apply consumable
 C-a          apply and keep choice
 p or i       pack item
 e            equip item
 s            stash and share item

Remaining item-related commands.

 keys         command
 E            manage equipment of the leader
 P or I       manage inventory pack of the leader
 S            manage the shared party stash
 G            manage items on the ground
 A            manage all owned items
 @            describe organs of the leader
 #            show skill summary of the leader
 ~            display known lore

 Note how lower case item commands (pack an item, equip, stash)
 let you move items into a particular item store, while
 upper case item commands (manage Pack, Equipment, Stash, etc.)
 let you view and organize items within an item store.
 Once a store management menu is opened, you can switch
 stores at will, so the multiple commands only determine
 the starting item store. Each store is accessible
 from the dashboard as well.

Mouse commands.

 Screen area and UI mode (exploration/aiming) determine
 mouse click effects. First, we give an overview
 of effects of each button over the game map area.
 The list includes not only left and right buttons, but also
 the optional middle mouse button (MMB) and the mouse wheel,
 which is also used over menus, to page-scroll them.
 (For mice without RMB, one can use Control key with LMB and for mice
 without MMB, one can use C-RMB or C-S-LMB.)
 Next we show mouse button effects per screen area,
 in exploration mode and (if different) in aiming mode.

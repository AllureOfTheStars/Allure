 Minimal cheat sheet for casual play

 Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (right diagram below)
 or the Vi editor keys (middle) or the left-hand movement keys (left). Run until
 disturbed with Shift or Control. Go-to a position with LMB (left mouse button).
 In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the aiming crosshair.

      q w e     y k u     7 8 9
       \|/       \|/       \|/
      a-s-d     h-.-l     4-5-6
       /|\       /|\       /|\
      z x c     b j n     1 2 3

 Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait, bracing for impact, which reduces any
 damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press `S-KP_5` or `C-KP_5`
 (the same key with Shift or Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.

 Displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or S-LMB. Search,
 open, descend and melee by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
 The best, and not on cooldown, melee weapon is automatically chosen
 for attack from your equipment and from among your body parts.

 The following few commands, joined with the movement and running keys,
 let you accomplish almost anything in the game, though not necessarily
 with the fewest keystrokes. You can also play the game exclusively
 with a mouse, or both mouse and keyboard (e.g., mouse for go-to
 and terrain inspection and keyboard for everything else). Lastly,
 you can select a command with arrows or mouse directly from the help
 screen or the dashboard and execute it on the spot.

  keys         command
  I            manage the shared inventory stash
  g or ,       grab item(s)
  ESC          clear messages/open main menu/finish aiming
  RET or INS   open dashboard/accept target
  SPACE        clear messages/show history/cycle detail level
  TAB          cycle among all party members

  /            cycle crosshair among items
  M            modify any admissible terrain
  %            yell or yawn and stop sleeping


 Optional mouse commands

 Screen area and UI mode (exploration/aiming) determine mouse click
 effects. Here we give an overview of effects of each button over
 the game map area. The list includes not only left and right buttons,
 but also the optional middle mouse button (MMB) and the mouse wheel,
 which is also used over menus to move selection. For mice without RMB,
 one can use Control key with LMB and for mice without MMB, one can use
 C-RMB or C-S-LMB.

  keys         command (exploration/aiming)
  LMB          go to pointer for 25 steps/fling at enemy
  S-LMB        run to pointer collectively for 25 steps/fling at enemy
  RMB or C-LMB start aiming at enemy under pointer/cycle detail level
  S-RMB        modify terrain at pointer
  MMB or C-RMB snap crosshair to floor under pointer/cycle detail level
  WHEEL-UP     swerve the aiming line
  WHEEL-DN     unswerve the aiming line

 Note that mouse is optional. Keyboard suffices, occasionally requiring
 a lookup for an obscure command key in help screens.

 All item-related commands

  keys         command
  I            manage the shared inventory stash
  O            manage the equipment outfit of the pointman
  g or ,       grab item(s)
  r            remove item(s)
  f            fling in-range projectile
  C-f          auto-fling and keep choice
  t            trigger consumable item
  C-t          trigger item and keep choice
  i            stash item into shared inventory
  o            equip item into outfit of the pointman
  G            manage items on the ground
  T            manage our total team belongings

All items belonging to your team are stored either in the character's local inventory (called the character's outfit) or in the shared inventory that is accessible by every team member (called the team stash). Items that are in the character's outfit can be accessed by or are beneficial for this particular character only. Stashed items can be accessed by the team members (unless the character is injured or panicking). But no one has a direct advantage from having the items in the shared inventory. 
The stashed items are exactly stashed, they are not simply laying on the ground (although the stash has a physical location on the map). You cannot operate the items from the stash, as if these items are just on the ground directly. To collect an item from the stash or add it there, you should enter the stash management menu by pressing the 'I'. 

Obviously, if the item is beneficial (a piece of armor, weapon, or a bonus item), it is reasonable to put it into a particular character's outfit. However, you should remember that the outfit is limited to any 10 (ten) items only. On the contrary, if the item is not required directly (ranged projectiles, medkits, ampoules with drugs, or food), it may be stored in the shared stash. 
The shared stash is of unlimited size. It has a physical location on the map and may be looted by your enemies. So, it is wise to keep it safe or change its location depending on the current situation. Enemy factions may have their stashes on the map, and you may loot their stashes too. Enemy units may have items in their outfits, and sometimes they may have some items stashed on the ground. 
You should keep your eye on the item management stat in the character menu '#'. If this stat is too low (which may be caused by injury or panic), you will be unable to work with items either in the character's outfit or in the shared stash.

To open the pointsman's outfit, press 'O' (if you want to see the pointsman's personal inventory outfit and manipulate items stored there) or 'i' (if you want to stash something in the shared inventory from the pointsman's outfit).
To open the shared stash, press 'I'.
To open the whole team's belongings (personal and stashed), press 'T'.
To manage items on the ground (trigger or fling it directly not putting it into any inventory to save time), press 'G'.

To pick up an item from the ground to the pointsman's outfit, press 'g'.
To pick up an item from the ground to the stashed inventory, press ','.

When you are managing items in the inventory or on the ground, you should choose the item with the LMB or arrows and 'RET' buttons to get the item management menu. You may want to choose all items from the particular location by pressing '*'.

To drop an item on the ground from the inventory (either stashed or from the personal outfit), press 'r'.
To trigger the item's properties (inject an ampoule, activate a chip, eat a piece of food), press 't'.
To throw (fling) the item somewhere, press 'f'.
To put the item into the particular outfit (personal or shared), press 'o' (personal outfit) or 'i' (shared inventory).

You may want to travel around the characters' inventories without leaving the inventory menu. To do that, you may press '<' or '>' to check different inventories: character's outfit, stashed inventory, objects on the ground, etc. You may also change pointsmen that are adjusting inventory by pressing the 'TAB' command.

 Note how lower case item commands (stash item, equip item) place items
 into a particular item store, while upper case item commands (manage Inventory,
 manage Outfit) open management menu for a store. Once a store menu is opened,
 you can switch stores with `<` and `>`, so the multiple commands only determine
 the starting item store. Each store is accessible from the dashboard as well.

Quite often, you will need to modify your environment somehow. There are numerous ways how to do that, so try, experiment!
You may craft items, change the terrain, cook food, upgrade or change items, and many other things!
For example, to craft items, you need some basic components and a workshop station or any other terrain that may be used to modify items (a pool of water, a burning tile, etc). Stand next to the workshop station, drop the components, stand on them, and press 'M'. The components will be automatically consumed, and the resulting item will appear. For example, you may want to craft a club from a wooden stick and several steel scraps. Approach a workshop, drop the components, and press 'M'.
Some crafting recipies may be found by pressing the '~' command while looking at the terrain you want to use.

It is always good to check the condition of your character. This information is available by pressing '@' (general information about the character) and '#' (it will tell you the character's stats). You should check them from time to time.
The '@' command will show you the general information about the chosen character: Which organs this character has and how they function, and information about his/her psychological condition or individual traits (beneficial or detrimental). 
The same information about enemies may be found by the '~' command while the enemy unit is in the crosshair. It is good to check this information as it may give you some clues about your own characters and your enemies. For example, you see an unknown creature. How to react to it? Is it dangerous? Check its lore menu and the organs it has! It may help you to generate the appropriate strategy. Because for example, the enemy that can call for help may be the target #1.
The '#' command shows more applied information: it shows the character's characteristics. Melee or ranged combat modifiers, armor stats, speed, ability to manage items on the ground or in the shared inventory, ability to modify terrain and craft items, vision, hearing - all this information may be found in the skill summary menu.

Minimal cheat sheet for casual play (1/2).

 Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (left diagram below)
 or its compact laptop replacement (middle) or the Vi text editor keys (right,
 enabled in config.ui.ini). Run, until disturbed, by adding Shift or Control.
 Go-to with LMB (left mouse button). Run collectively with RMB.

 In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair (aiming crosshair).
 Press 'KP_5' ('5' on keypad, or 'i' or '.') to wait, bracing for impact,
 which reduces any damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press
 'C-KP_5' (the same key with Control) to wait 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.
 You displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or RMB. Search,
 open, descend and attack by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
 The best item to attack with is automatically chosen from among weapons
 in your personal equipment and your body parts.


Minimal cheat sheet for casual play (2/2).

 The following commands, joined with the basic set above, let you accomplish
 anything in the game, though not necessarily with the fewest keystrokes.
 You can also play the game exclusively with a mouse, or both mouse and
 keyboard. See the ending help screens for mouse commands. Lastly, you can
 select a command with arrows or mouse directly from the help screen
 or the dashboard and execute it on the spot.

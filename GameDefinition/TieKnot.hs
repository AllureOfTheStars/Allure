-- The action monad types to be used are determined by the 'executorSer'
-- and 'executorCli' calls. If other functions are used in their place
-- the types are different and so the whole pattern of computation
-- is different. Which of the frontends is run inside the UI client
-- depends on the flags supplied when compiling the engine library.

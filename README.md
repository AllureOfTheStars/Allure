Allure of the Stars
===================

This is an alpha release of Allure of the Stars,
a near-future Sci-Fi [roguelike] [2] and tactical squad game.
Long-term goals are high replayability and auto-balancing
through procedural content generation and persistent content
modification based on player behaviour. The game is written in [Haskell] [1]
using the [LambdaHack] [5] roguelike game engine.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The game is best compiled and installed via Cabal, which also takes care
of all dependencies. The latest official version of the game can be downloaded
automatically by Cabal from [Hackage] [4] as follows

    cabal install Allure

For a newer version, install a matching LambdaHack library snapshot
from a development branch, download the game source from [github] [3]
and run 'cabal install' from the main directory.

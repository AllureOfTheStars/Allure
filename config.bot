; This is the default config file, included in the binary itself.
; The game looks for the user config file in ~/.Allure/config.
; We restricts the config file format by insisting that
; options are case-sensitive and permitting only ';' comments.

; If you contribute to the game, please create directory ~/.Allure/
; as described in README.md. In this way, you will not accidentally
; commit your private high scores (nor your save files) to the game
; git repository.

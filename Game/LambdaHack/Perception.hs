-- | A location can be directly lit by an ambient shine or a portable
-- light source, e.g,, carried by a hero. (Only lights of radius 0
-- are considered for now.) A location is visible if it's directly lit
-- or adjacent to one that is directly lit _and_ reachable. The last condition
-- approximates being on the same side of obstacles as the light source.
-- The approximation is not exact for multiple heroes, but the discrepancy
-- can be attributed to deduction based on combined vague visual hints,
-- e.g., if I don't see the reachable light seen by another hero,
-- there must be a wall in-between. Stray rays indicate doors,
-- moving shadows indicate monsters, etc.).

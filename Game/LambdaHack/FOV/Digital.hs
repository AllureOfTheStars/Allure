Derivation of the formula:
The intersection point (xt, yt) satisfies the following equalities:
yt = d
(yt - y) (xf - x) = (xt - x) (yf - y)
hence
(yt - y) (xf - x) = (xt - x) (yf - y)
(d - y) (xf - x) = (xt - x) (yf - y)
(d - y) (xf - x) + x (yf - y) = xt (yf - y)
xt = ((d - y) (xf - x) + x (yf - y)) / (yf - y)

General remarks:
A diamond is denoted by its left corner. Hero at (0, 0).
Order of processing in the first quadrant rotated by 45 degrees is
 45678
  123
   @
so the first processed diamond is at (-1, 1). The order is similar
as for the restrictive shadow casting algorithm and reversed wrt PFOV.
The line in the curent state of mscan is called the shallow line,
but it's the one that delimits the view from the left, while the steep
line is on the right, opposite to PFOV. We start scanning from the left.

The Loc coordinates are cartesian. The Bump coordinates are cartesian,
translated so that the hero is at (0, 0) and rotated so that he always
looks at the first (rotated 45 degrees) quadrant. The (Progress, Distance)
cordinates coincide with the Bump coordinates, unlike in PFOV.

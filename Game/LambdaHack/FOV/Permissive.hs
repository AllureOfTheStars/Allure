-- | PFOV (Permissive Field of View) clean-room reimplemented based on the algorithm described in <http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Precise_Permissive_Field_of_View>,
-- though the general structure is more influenced by recursive shadow casting,
-- as implemented in Shadow.hs. In the result, this algorithm is much faster
-- than the original algorithm on dense maps, since it does not scan
-- areas blocked by shadows.
-- See <https://github.com/Mikolaj/Allure/wiki/Fov-and-los>

Derivation of the formula:
The intersection point (xt, yt) satisfies the following equalities:
xt = 1 + d - yt
(yt - y) (xf - x) = (xt - x) (yf - y)
hence
(yt - y) (xf - x) = (xt - x) (yf - y)
yt (xf - x) - y xf = xt (yf - y) - x yf
yt (xf - x) - y xf = (1 + d) (yf - y) - yt (yf - y) - x yf
yt (xf - x) + yt (yf - y) = (1 + d) (yf - y) - x yf + y xf
yt = ((1 + d) (yf - y) + y xf - x yf) / (xf - x + yf - y)

General remarks:
A square is denoted by its bottom-left corner. Hero at (0, 0).
Order of processing in the first quadrant is
9
58
247
@136
so the first processed square is at (0, 1). The order is reversed
wrt the restrictive shadow casting algorithm. The line in the curent state
of mscan is not the steep line, but the shallow line,
and we start scanning from the bottom right.

The Loc coordinates are cartesian. The Bump coordinates are cartesian,
translated so that the hero is at (0, 0) and rotated so that he always
looks at the first quadrant. The (Progress, Distance) cordinates
are mangled and not used for geometry.

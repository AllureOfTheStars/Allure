Font 16x16xw.bdf is derived from 16x16x.fon by changing all but
a few glyphs, converting to BDF format, extending character set
and hacking the font file with bdftopcf and pcf2bdf to include
full bitmaps, not only non-zero portions, for otherwise SDL2-ttf
was not able to display the glyphs.
Font 16x16xw.woff was derived from 16x16xw.bdf by changing format
to TTF with bitsnpicas, faking descendent offsets to be 1 point lower
to prevent freetype from adding an extra pixel to the descendent,
tweaking with fontforge glyps 3 5 6 8 A a S s b d h to prevent antialiasing
of their vital parts when zoomed out, auto-hinting, manually simplifying
hints in some glyphs and converting to WOFF format.

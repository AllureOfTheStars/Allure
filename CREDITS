Fonts 16x16xw.woff, 16x16xw.bdf, 16x16x.fnt, 8x8x.fnt and 8x8xb.fnt
are are derived from fonts taken from
https://github.com/angband/angband, copyrighted by Leon Marrick,
Sheldon Simms III and Nick McConnell and released by them under
GNU GPL, version 2 or any later version (confirmed at
http://www.thangorodrim.net/development/opensource.html).
Any further modifications by authors of LambdaHack
are also released under GNU GPL version 2. The licence file is at
GameDefinition/fonts/LICENSE.16x16x in the source code tree.

Font 16x16xw.bdf is derived from 16x16x.fon by changing all but
a few glyphs, converting to BDF format, extending character set
and hacking the font file with bdftopcf and pcf2bdf to include
full bitmaps, not only non-zero portions, for otherwise SDL2-ttf
was not able to display the glyphs.
Font 16x16xw.woff was derived from 16x16xw.bdf by changing format
to TTF with bitsnpicas, faking descendent offsets to be 1 point lower
to prevent freetype from adding an extra pixel to the descendent,
tweaking with fontforge glyphs 3 5 6 8 A a S s b d h to prevent antialiasing
of their vital parts when zoomed out, auto-hinting, manually simplifying
hints in some glyphs and converting to WOFF format.

The sources are modified and processed as follows (see
https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/issues/193 for background):

in Roman/Instances/Semibold/font.ufo/glyphs/s.glif
put advance width="452"
rm Roman/Instances/Semibold/font.ufo/data/com.adobe.type.processedHashMap
bash build.sh
pyftfeatfreeze -f 'cv03' -S -U LH -R 'Source/Binary' target/TTF/SourceSansPro-Semibold.ttf BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf
pyftsubset BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf --unicodes="*" --flavor=woff --with-zopfli --output-file=BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf.woff

and similarly for BinarySansProLH-Regular.ttf.woff, while
for BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf.woff the last steps are:

pyftfeatfreeze -f 'cv02' -S -U LH -R 'Source/Binary' target/TTF/SourceCodePro-Bold.ttf BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf
pyftsubset BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf --unicodes="*" --flavor=woff --with-zopfli --output-file=BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf.woff

Fonts ubuntu-v14-latin-ext_latin-regular.ttf.woff,
ubuntu-v14-latin-ext_latin-500.ttf.woff
and ubuntu-mono-v9-latin-ext_latin-700.ttf.woff
are generated via google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com
from 'Ubuntu Font Family' fonts with the following copyright notice:
Copyright 2011 Canonical Ltd. Licensed under the Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0
The licence file is at GameDefinition/fonts/UFL.txt in the source code tree.

The files are compressed with pyftsubset to save some space and make
sure they are created from TTF, not OTF fonts. Unfortunately, being TTF
fonts and having broken hinting in the mono variant, they require
forcing TTF.Light hinting in the SDL frontend. If ever OTF fonts
emerge, they should be used instead (similarly compressed).

Warning: the Ubuntu Font Family fonts are considered non-free by Debian
and so we don't include them in Debian and some other GNU/Linux packages.
If you use such a package, feel free to download the fonts from the web
or create links to their locations in non-free Debian package fonts-ubuntu.
